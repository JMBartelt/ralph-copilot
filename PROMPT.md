@[TASKS] @[ACTIVITY]
@[RESEARCH]

First read activity.md to see what was recently accomplished.

When testing with chrome-devtools, start the site locally with npm run dev. If port is taken, try another port.

Open [TASKS] and choose the single highest priority task where passes is false.

Helpful docs on initial state at the start of this sprint are in [RESEARCH]

Work on exactly ONE task: implement the change. 

After implementing, use chrome-devtools to:
1. Navigate to the local server URL
2. Take a screenshot and save it as screenshots/[task-name].png

Append a dated progress entry to activity.md describing what you changed and the screenshot filename.

Update that task's passes in [TASKS] from false to true.

Make one git commit for that task only with a clear message.

Do not git init, do not change remotes, do not push.

ONLY WORK ON A SINGLE TASK.

When ALL tasks have passes true, output <promise>COMPLETE</promise>
